Description: Functions to design and apply tests that are anytime valid. The 
  functions can be used to design hypothesis tests in the prospective/randomised 
  control trial setting or in the observational/retrospective setting. The 
  resulting tests remain valid under both optional stopping and optional 
  continuation. The current version includes safe t-tests and safe tests of 
  two proportions. For details on the theory of safe tests, see 
  Grunwald, de Heide and Koolen (2019) "Safe Testing". <arXiv:1906.07801>.
