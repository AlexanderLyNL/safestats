Description: Functions to design and apply tests that are anytime valid. The
  functions can be used to design hypothesis tests in the prospective/randomised
  control trial setting or in the observational/retrospective setting. The
  resulting tests remain valid under both optional stopping and optional
  continuation. The current version includes safe t-tests and safe tests of
  two proportions. For details on the theory of safe tests, see
  Grunwald, de Heide and Koolen (2019) "Safe Testing" <arXiv:1906.07801>, 
  for details on safe logrank tests see ter Schure, Perez-Ortiz, Ly and Grunwald
  (2020) "The Safe Logrank Test: Error Control under Continuous Monitoring with 
  Unlimited Horizon" <arXiv:2011.06931v3> and Turner, Ly and Grunwald (2021)

  beyond" <arXiv:2106.02693> for details on safe contingency table tests.
