Description: This package is for designing and applying safe hypothesis tests.
  It can be used for designing hypothesis tests in the prospective/ RCT setting,
  where the tests can be used under optional stopping. The 'pilot' functions in 
  the package also enable using the safe tests in the observational/ retrospective
  setting. The current version includes safe t-tests and tests of two proportions.
