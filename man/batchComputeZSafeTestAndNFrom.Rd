\usage{
batchComputeZSafeTestAndNFrom(
  meanDiffMin,
  alpha = 0.05,
  beta = 0.2,
  sigma = 1,
  kappa = sigma,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less"),
  testType = c("oneSample", "paired", "twoSample"),
  tol = 1e-05,
  highN = 8e+09,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{meanDiffMin}{numeric that defines the minimal relevant mean difference, the smallest population mean
that we would like to detect.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule e10 > 1/alpha.}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both "n"
and "phiS". Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{sigma}{numeric > 0 representing the assumed population standard deviation used for the test.}

\item{kappa}{the true population standard deviation. Default kappa=sigma.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{testType}{either one of "oneSample", "paired", "twoSample".}

\item{tol}{a number that defines the stepsizes between the lowParam and highParam.}

\item{highN}{integer that stops the search process if the lower bound for the candidate nPlan exceeds this
number. Default highN is set 8e9 to correspond to the current population of the earth.}

\item{ratio}{numeric > 0 representing the randomisation ratio of condition 2 over condition 1. If testType
is not equal to "twoSample", or if nPlan is of length(1) then ratio=1.}

\item{parameter}{optional test defining parameter. Default set to \code{NULL}.}

\item{grow}{logical, defaul set to \code{TRUE} so the grow safe test is used in the design.}

\item{designScenario}{a character string specifying the scenario for which needs designing either
"1a" or "1b"}
}
\value{
a list which contains at least nPlan and the phiS the parameter that defines the safe test
}
