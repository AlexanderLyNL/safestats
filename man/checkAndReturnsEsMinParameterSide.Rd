\arguments{
\item{paramToCheck}{numeric. Either a named safe test defining parameter such as phiS, or thetaS, or a
minimal clinically relevant effect size called with a non-null esMinName name}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "twoSided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{esMinName}{provides the name of the effect size. Either "meanDiffMin" for the z-test, "deltaMin" for
the t-test, or "hrMin" for the logrank test}

\item{paramDomain}{Domain of the paramToCheck, typically, positiveNumbers. Default \code{NULL}}
