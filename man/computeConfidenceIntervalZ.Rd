\usage{
computeConfidenceIntervalZ(
  nEff,
  meanObs,
  parameter,
  sigma = 1,
  ciValue = 0.95,
  alternative = "twoSided",
  a = NULL,
  g = NULL,
  intervalType = c("eCauchy", "eGauss", "grow", "freq", "credibleInterval"),
  maxRoot = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nEff}{numeric > 0, the effective sample size.}

\item{meanObs}{numeric, the observed mean. For two sample tests this is difference of the means.}

\item{parameter}{numeric > 0, the safe test defining parameter.}

\item{sigma}{numeric > 0 representing the assumed population standard deviation used for the test.}

\item{ciValue}{numeric is the ciValue-level of the confidence sequence. Default ciValue=0.95.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "twoSided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{a}{numeric, the centre of the normal prior on population mean (of the normal data). Default
is \code{NULL}, which implies the default choice of setting the centre equal to the null hypothesis.}

\item{g}{numeric > 0, used to define g sigma^2 as the variance of the normal prior on the population
(of the normal data). Default is \code{NULL} in which case g=phiS^2/sigma^2.}

\item{intervalType}{character string, one of "eGauss", "grow", "freq", "credibleInterval".
"eGauss" yields an anytime-valid confidence interval based on a Gaussian mixture. "grow" yields an
anytime-valid confidence interval using a mixture of point masses at the minimal clinically relevant
mean difference. This confidence interval unfortunately does not shrink as the sample size tends to
infinity. "freq" yields the standard frequentist confidence interval, which is not safe.
"credibleInterval" yields the credible interval based on a conjugate prior as is usual in Bayesian
analysis. This interval is also not safe.}

\item{maxRoot}{Used to determine the maximum width for the z statistic whenever intervalType="eCauchy"}
}
\value{
numeric vector that contains the upper and lower bound of the safe confidence sequence
