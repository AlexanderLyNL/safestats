\usage{
computeConfidenceIntervalZ(
  nEff,
  meanObs,
  parameter,
  sigma = 1,
  ciValue = 0.95,
  alternative = "twoSided",
  a = NULL,
  g = NULL,
  eType = c("mom", "eGauss", "imom", "eCauchy", "grow", "freq", "credibleInterval"),
  maxRoot = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nEff}{numeric > 0, the effective sample size.}

\item{meanObs}{numeric, the observed mean. For two sample tests this is difference of the means.}

\item{parameter}{numeric > 0, the safe test defining parameter.}

\item{sigma}{numeric > 0 representing the assumed population standard deviation used for the test.}

\item{ciValue}{numeric is the ciValue-level of the confidence sequence. Default ciValue=NULL, and ciValue = 1 - alpha}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "twoSided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{a}{numeric, only used for eType="credibleInterval". a specifies the centre of the Gaussian
prior on population mean.}

\item{g}{numeric > 0, only used for eType="credibleInterval". g specifies the variance of
the Gaussian prior on population mean.}

\item{eType}{character string, one of "eCauchy", "eGauss", "grow", "freq", "credibleInterval".
This is somewhat a misnomer as "freq" and "credibleInterval" do not correspond to e-value tests.
"eCauchy" yields an anytime-valid confidence interval based on a Cauchy mixture,
whereas "eGauss" yields an anytime-valid confidence interval based on a Gaussian mixture.
"grow" yields an anytime-valid confidence interval based on a mixture of point masses
at the minimal clinically relevant mean difference. This confidence interval unfortunately
does not shrink as the sample size tends to infinity. "freq" yields the standard unsafe frequentist
confidence interval, which is not safe. "credibleInterval" yields the Bayesian credible interval
based on a conjugate prior as is usual in Bayesian analysis. This interval is also not safe.}

\item{maxRoot}{Used to bound the candidate set of width of the confidence interval,
whenever eType="eCauchy"}
}
\value{
numeric vector that contains the upper and lower bound of the safe confidence sequence
