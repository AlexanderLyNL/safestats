\arguments{
\item{hrMin}{numeric that defines the minimal relevant hazard ratio, the smallest hazard ratio that we want to
detect.}

\item{nEvents}{numeric > 0, targetted number of events.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule e10 > 1/alpha.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, which must be one of
"twoSided" (default),"greater" or "less". The alternative is pitted against the null hypothesis of equality
of the survival distributions. More specifically, let lambda1 be the hazard rate of group 1 (i.e., placebo), and
lambda2 the hazard ratio of group 2 (i.e., treatment), then the null hypothesis states that the hazard ratio
theta = lambda2/lambda1 = 1. If alternative = "less", the null hypothesis is compared to theta < 1, thus,
lambda2 < lambda1, that is, the hazard of group 2 (i.e., treatment) is less than that of group 1 (i.e., placebo),
hence, the treatment is beneficial. If alternative = "greater", then the null hypothesis is compared to theta > 1,
thus, lambda2 > lambda1, hence, harm.}

\item{m0}{Number of subjects in the control group 0/1 at the beginning of the trial, i.e., nPlan[1].}

\item{m1}{Number of subjects in the treatment group 1/2 at the beginning of the trial, i.e., nPlan[2].}

\item{testType}{either one of "oneSample", "paired", "twoSample".}

\item{ratio}{numeric > 0 representing the randomisation ratio of condition 2 (Treatment) over condition 1 (Placebo),
thus, m1/m0. Note that m1 and m0 are not used to specify ratio. Ratio is only used when \code{zApprox=TRUE}, which
ignores m1 and m0.}

\item{parameter}{Numeric > 0, represents the safe tests defining thetaS. Default NULL so it's decided by the
algorithm, typically, this equals hrMin, which corresponds to the GROW choice.}

\item{eType}{character one of "eCauchy", "eGauss", "grow". "eCauchy" yields e-values based on
a Cauchy mixture, "eGauss" based on a Gaussian/normal mixture, and "grow" based on a mixture of
two point masses at the minimal clinically relevant effect size.}

\item{wantSamplePaths}{logical, if \code{TRUE} then also outputs the sample paths.}

\item{groupSizePerTimeFunction}{A function without parameters and integer output. This function provides the number
of events at each time step. For instance, if \code{rpois(1, 7)} leads to a random number of events at each time
step.}

\item{pb}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, then show progress bar.}

\item{seed}{integer, seed number.}

\item{nSim}{integer > 0, the number of simulations needed to compute power or the number of events for the exact
safe logrank test under continuous monitoring}

\item{nBoot}{integer > 0 representing the number of bootstrap samples to assess the accuracy of the approximation of
power or nEvents for the exact safe logrank test under continuous monitoring}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}
