alpha and beta.}
\usage{
computeLogrankNEvents(
  hrMin,
  beta,
  m0 = 50000,
  m1 = 50000,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less"),

  nBoot = 1000L,
  groupSizePerTimeFunction = returnOne,
  nMax = Inf,
  parameter = NULL,
  pb = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hrMin}{numeric that defines the minimal relevant hazard ratio, the smallest hazard ratio that we want to
detect.}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both "n"
and "phiS". Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{m0}{Number of subjects in the control group 0/1 at the beginning of the trial, i.e., nPlan[1].}

\item{m1}{Number of subjects in the treatment group 1/2 at the beginning of the trial, i.e., nPlan[2].}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule e10 > 1/alpha.}

\item{alternative}{The null hypothesis of equality of the survival distribution of y in the groups defined by x is
tested. When alternative is "two.sided" the null hypothesis theta = h0, where theta = lambda2/lambda1 is the
hazard ratio, and compared to theta != h0. If alternative = "less", the null hypothesis is compared to
theta <= h0. For h0=1 the alternative specifies that survival in population 1 is higher than in population 2.
When alternative = "greater", the null hypothesis is compared to the alternative theta >= h0. For h0=1 the
alternative specifies that survival in population 2 is higher than in population 1.}

\item{nSim}{integer > 0, the number of simulations needed to compute power or the number of events for the exact
safe logrank test under continuous monitoring}

\item{nBoot}{integer > 0 representing the number of bootstrap samples to assess the accuracy of the approximation of
power or nEvents for the exact safe logrank test under continuous monitoring}

\item{groupSizePerTimeFunction}{A function without parameters and integer output. This function provides the number
of events at each time step. For instance, if \code{rpois(1, 7)} leads to a random number of events at each time
step.}

\item{nMax}{An integer. Once nEvents hits nMax the experiment terminates, if it didn't stop due to threshold
crossing crossing already. Default is Inf}

\item{parameter}{Numeric > 0, represents the safe tests defining thetaS. Default NULL so it's decided by the
algorithm, typically, this equals hrMin, which corresponds to the GROW choice.}

\item{pb}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, then show progress bar.}
