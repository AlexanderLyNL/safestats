sample size}
\usage{
computeMinEsBatchSafeZ(
  nPlan,
  alpha = 0.05,
  beta = 0.2,
  sigma = 1,
  kappa = sigma,
  alternative = c("twoSided", "greater", "less"),
  testType = c("oneSample", "paired", "twoSample"),
  parameter = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{nPlan}{optional numeric vector of length at most 2. When provided, it is used to find the safe test
defining parameter phiS. Note that if the purpose is to plan based on nPlan alone, then both meanDiffMin
and beta should be set to NULL.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule e10 > 1/alpha.}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both "n"
and "phiS". Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{sigma}{numeric > 0 representing the assumed population standard deviation used for the test.}

\item{kappa}{the true population standard deviation. Default kappa=sigma.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "twoSided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{testType}{either one of "oneSample", "paired", "twoSample".}

\item{parameter}{optional numeric test defining parameter. Default set to \code{NULL}.
For eType=="eCauchy" the numerator is a mixture with meanDiff/sigma mixed
over a Cauchy distribution centred at zero and scale kappaG. For eType=="eGauss"
the numerator is a mixture with meanDiff/sigma mixed over a Gaussian centred at
zero and variance g. For eType=="grow" the safe test is a likelihood ratio of z distributions with in the
denominator the likelihood with mean difference 0 and in the numerator an average
likelihood defined by the likelihood at the parameter value phiS. For the two sided
case 1/2 at -phiS and 1/2 phiS.}

\item{eType}{character one of "eCauchy", "eGauss", "grow". "eCauchy" yields e-values based on
a Cauchy mixture, "eGauss" based on a Gaussian/normal mixture, and "grow" based on a mixture of
two point masses at the minimal clinically relevant effect size.}

\item{lowEsTrue}{numeric, lower bound for the candidate set of the
targeted minimal clinically relevant effect size.
Design scenario 3: nPlan and beta given, goal find meanDiffMin}

\item{highEsTrue}{numeric, upper bound for the candidate set of the
targeted minimal clinically relevant effect size.
Design scenario 3: nPlan and beta given, goal find meanDiffMin}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}
