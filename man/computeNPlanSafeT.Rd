\arguments{
\item{deltaTrue}{numeric, the value of the true standardised effect size (test-relevant parameter).
This argument is used by `designSafeT()` with `deltaTrue <- deltaMin`}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both
the sample sizes and deltaS, which defines the test. Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent of n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule e10 > 1/alpha.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "twoSided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{testType}{either one of "oneSample", "paired", "twoSample".}

\item{lowN}{integer minimal sample size of the (first) sample when computing the power due to
optional stopping. Default lowN is set 1.}

\item{highN}{integer minimal sample size of the (first) sample when computing the power due to
optional stopping. Default highN is set 1e6.}

\item{ratio}{numeric > 0 representing the randomisation ratio of condition 2 over condition 1. If testType
is not equal to "twoSample", or if nPlan is of length(1) then ratio=1.}

\item{nSim}{integer > 0, the number of simulations needed to compute power or the number of samples paths
for the safe z test under continuous monitoring.}

\item{nBoot}{integer > 0 representing the number of bootstrap samples to assess the accuracy of
approximation of the power, the number of samples for the safe z test under continuous monitoring,
or for the computation of the logarithm of the implied target.}

\item{parameter}{optional numeric test defining parameter. Default set to \code{NULL}.
For eType=="eCauchy" the numerator is a mixture with meanDiff/sigma mixed
over a Cauchy distribution centred at zero and scale kappaG. For eType=="eGauss"
the numerator is a mixture with meanDiff/sigma mixed over a Gaussian centred at
zero and variance g. For eType=="grow" the safe test is a likelihood ratio of the
non-central t-distributions with in the denominator the likelihood with non-centrality
parameter set to 0, and in the numerator an average likelihood defined by the likelihood
at the non-centrality parameter value deltaS. For the two sided
case 1/2 at -deltaS and 1/2 deltaS.}

\item{pb}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, then show progress bar.}

\item{nMax}{integer > 0, maximum sample size of the (first) sample in each sample path.}

\item{seed}{integer, seed number.}

\item{eType}{character one of "eCauchy", "eGauss", "grow". "eCauchy" yields e-values based on
a Cauchy mixture, "eGauss" based on a Gaussian/normal mixture, and "grow" based on a mixture of
two point masses at the minimal clinically relevant standardised effect size.}

\item{wantSamplePaths}{logical, if \code{TRUE} then also outputs the sample paths.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods, but mainly to perform do.calls.}
