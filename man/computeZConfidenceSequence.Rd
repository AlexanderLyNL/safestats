\title{Helper function: Computes the safe confidence sequence for a z-test}
\usage{
computeZConfidenceSequence(
  nEff,
  meanStat,
  phiS,
  sigma = 1,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = "two.sided"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nEff}{numeric > 0, the effective sample size}

\item{meanStat}{numeric, the mean statistic, this could be the differences of means as well}

\item{phiS}{numeric > 0, the safe test defining parameter}

\item{sigma}{numeric > 0 representing the assumed population standard deviation used for the test.}

\item{alpha}{numeric representing the tolerable type I error rate. This also serves as a decision rule and it was
shown that for safe tests S we have P(S > 1/alpha) < alpha under the null.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}
}
\value{
numeric vector that contains the upper and lower bound of the safe confidence sequence
}
