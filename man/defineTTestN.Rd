\title{Computes a Sequence of (Effective) Sample Sizes}
\usage{
defineTTestN(
  lowN = 3,
  highN = 100,
  ratio = 1,
  testType = c("oneSample", "paired", "twoSample")
)

defineTTestN(
  lowN = 3,
  highN = 100,
  ratio = 1,
  testType = c("oneSample", "paired", "twoSample")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lowN}{integer that defines the smallest n of our search space for n.}

\item{highN}{integer that defines the largest n of our search space for n. This might be the largest n that we
are able to fund.}

\item{ratio}{numeric > 0 representing the randomisation ratio of condition 2 over condition 1. If testType
is not equal to "twoSample", or if nPlan is of length(1) then ratio=1.}

\item{testType}{either one of "oneSample", "paired", "twoSample".}
}
\value{
Returns the sample sizes and degrees of freedom.

Returns the sample sizes and degrees of freedom.

\description{
Helper function that outputs the sample sizes, effective sample sizes and the degrees of
freedom depending on the type of t-test. Also used for z-tests.
