\usage{
designFreqT(
  deltaMin,
  alpha = 0.05,
  beta = 0.2,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less"),

\arguments{
\item{deltaMin}{numeric that defines the minimal relevant effect size, the smallest effect size that we want to
detect.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent of n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule S10 > 1/alpha}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both
the sample sizes and deltaS, which defines the test. Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less"}

\item{lowN}{integer that defines the smallest n of our search space for n}

\item{highN}{integer that defines the largest n of our search space for n. This might be the largest n that we
are able to fund.}

\item{testType}{either one of "oneSampleT", "pairedSampleT", "twoSampleT"}

\item{sampleSizeRatio}{numeric representing n2/n1. If n2 equals \code{NULL} then sampleSizeRatio=1}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods, but mainly to perform do.calls}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "freqTDesign". An object of class "freqTDesign" is a list containing at least the
following components:
\describe{
  \item{n1PlanFreq}{the planned sample size of the first group}
  \item{deltaMin}{the minimal clinical effect size provided by the user}
  \item{alpha}{the tolerable type I error provided by the user}
  \item{beta}{the tolerable type II error provided by the user}
  \item{lowN}{the smallest n of the search space for n provided by the user}
  \item{highN}{the largest n of the search space for n provided by the user}
  \item{testType}{any of "oneSampleT", "pairedSampleT", "twoSampleT" provided by the user}#'
  \item{alternative}{any of "two.sided", "greater", "less" provided by the user}
}

\description{
Computes the number of samples necessary to reach a tolerable type I and type II error for the frequentist t-test
