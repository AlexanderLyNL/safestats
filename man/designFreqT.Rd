\usage{
designFreqT(
  deltaMin,
  alpha = 0.05,
  beta = 0.2,
  alternative = c("twoSided", "greater", "less"),
  h0 = 0,
  testType = c("oneSample", "paired", "twoSample"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{deltaMin}{numeric that defines the minimal relevant standardised effect size, the smallest effect size that
we would the experiment to be able to detect.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent of n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule e10 > 1/alpha.}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both
the sample sizes and deltaS, which defines the test. Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "twoSided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{h0}{a number indicating the hypothesised true value of the mean under the null. For the moment h0=0.}

\item{testType}{either one of "oneSample", "paired", "twoSample".}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods, but mainly to perform do.calls.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class 'freqTDesign'. An object of class 'freqTDesign' is a list containing at least the
following components:
\describe{
  \item{nPlan}{the planned sample size(s).}
  \item{esMin}{the minimal clinically relevant standardised effect size provided by the user.}
  \item{alpha}{the tolerable type I error provided by the user.}
  \item{beta}{the tolerable type II error provided by the user.}
  \item{lowN}{the smallest n of the search space for n provided by the user.}
  \item{highN}{the largest n of the search space for n provided by the user.}
  \item{testType}{any of "oneSample", "paired", "twoSample" provided by the user.}
  \item{alternative}{any of "twoSided", "greater", "less" provided by the user.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the number of samples necessary to reach a tolerable type I and type II error for the frequentist T-test.
