\title{Computes the number of samples necessary to reach a tolerable type I and type II error for the frequentist t-test}
\usage{
designFreqT(
  deltaMin,
  alpha = 0.05,
  beta = 0.2,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less"),
  lowN = 3L,
  highN = 100L,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{deltaMin}{numeric that defines the minimal relevant effect size, the smallests effect size that we want to
detect.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule S10 > 1/alpha}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that speficies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both "n"
and "deltaS". Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less"}

\item{lowN}{integer that defines the smallest n of our search space for n}

\item{highN}{integer that defines the largest n of our search space for n. This might be the largest n that we
are able to fund.}

\item{testType}{either one of "oneSampleT", "pairedSampleT", "twoSampleT"}

\item{sampleSizeRatio}{numeric representing n2/n1. If is.null(n2) then sampleSizeRatio=1}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods, but mainly to perform do.calls}
