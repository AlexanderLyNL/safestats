\usage{
designPilotSafeT(
  n1 = 50,
  n2 = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  mu0 = 0,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less"),

}
\arguments{
\item{n1, n2}{observed sample sizes}

\item{alpha}{the tolerable type I error to be conserved. Also defines the decision rule s > 1/alpha, and for
frequentist tests the decision rule is p < alpha.}

\item{mu0}{a number indicating the hypothesised true value of the mean under the null. For the moment mu0=0}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less"}

\item{lowDelta}{numeric that defines the smallest delta of our search space for the test-defining deltaS}

\item{highDelta}{numeric that defines the largest delta of our search space for the test-defining deltaS}

\item{tol}{a number that defines the stepsizes between the lowDelta and highDelta}

\item{inverseMethod}{logical, always \code{TRUE} for the moment}

\item{logging}{â€˜logical, if \code{TRUE}, then add invSToTThresh to output}

\item{paired}{logical, if \code{TRUE} then paired t-test}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "safeTDesign". An object of class "safeTDesign" is a list containing at least the
following components:

\describe{
  \item{n1Plan}{the planned sample size of the first group}
  \item{mu0}{the specified hypothesised value of the mean or mean difference depending on whether it was a one-sample
  or a two-sample test}
  \item{deltaS}{the deltaS that defines the safe test}
  \item{deltaMin}{the minimal clinical effect size provided by the user}
  \item{alpha}{the tolerable type I error provided by the user}
  \item{beta}{the tolerable type II error provided by the user}
  \item{lowDelta}{the smallest delta of the search space for delta provided by the user}
  \item{highDelta}{the largest delta of the search space for delta provided by the user}
  \item{tol}{the step size between lowDelta and highDelta provided by the user}
  \item{lowN}{the smallest n of the search space for n provided by the user}
  \item{highN}{the largest n of the search space for n provided by the user}
  \item{alternative}{any of "two.sided", "greater", "less" provided by the user}
  \item{testType}{any of "oneSampleT", "pairedSampleT", "twoSampleT" provided by the user}
  \item{sampleSizeRatio}{default is 1. Different from 1, whenever testType equals "twoSampleT", then it's defined
  sampleSizeRatio equals n2/n1}
  \item{pilot}{\code{FALSE} (default) specified by the user to indicate that the design is not a pilot study}
  \item{call}{the expression with which this function is called}
}

\description{
"Designs" a safe experiment for a prespecified tolerable type I error by pretending that the sample size is "known"
and fixed ahead of time. Outputs a list that includes the deltaS that defines the safe test.
