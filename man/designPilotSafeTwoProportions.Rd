\arguments{
\item{na}{Group size a}

\item{nb}{Group size b}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less"}

\item{alpha}{significance level that will be used for testing.
Default \code{0.05}.}

\item{M}{number of iterations used in the power simulations.
Default \code{1000}.}

\item{deltaMins}{vector of effect size values between 0 and 1 to find the S-value formula with the best
worst-case power for. For each value of delta.min, the power of several S-values defined by
the test deltas is simulated for several data generating distributions where the group mean
in group a differs \code{delta.min} with group mean b. It is advised to choose a wide range.
Default \code{seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1)}.}

\item{lowDelta}{numeric that defines the smallest delta of our search space for the test-defining deltaS}

\item{highDelta}{numeric that defines the largest delta of our search space for the test-defining deltaS}

\item{tol}{a number that defines the stepsizes between the lowDelta and highDelta}

\item{numberForSeed}{Optionally provide your own seed for the simulations.
Default \code{NA}.}

\description{
\code{designPilotSafeTwoProportions} finds for given sample size and significance level the
'most powerful' simple S-value formula: the S-value formula that provides the best
power in the worst case for all distributions in the alternative hypothesis.
In case of equal group sizes and two-sided testing, the best S-value can be found
analytically (working paper by Grunwald, Ly and Turner).
Otherwise, power simulations are used to find the S-value formula with the
most power in the worst case for a set of data generating distributions in the
alternative hypothesis.
