\usage{
designPilotSafeZ(
  n1 = 50,
  n2 = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less"),
  mu0 = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{n1, n2}{observed sample sizes}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule S10 > 1/alpha}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less"}

\item{mu0}{a number indicating the hypothesised true value of the mean under the null. For the moment mu0=0}

\item{tol}{a number that defines the stepsizes between the lowDelta and highDelta}

\item{paired}{logical, if TRUE then paired t-test}

\item{inverseMethod}{logical, always TRUE for the moment}

\item{logging}{â€˜logical, if TRUE, then add invSToTThresh to output}
}
\value{
Returns a safeDesign object
\describe{
  \item{n1Plan}{the sample size to plan for}
  \item{n2Plan}{the sample size of the second group when testType=="twoSampleT" or "pairedSampleT", otherwise NULL}
  \item{nEffPlan}{the resulting effective sample size when testType=="twoSampleT", otherwise non-existing}
  \item{deltaS}{the deltaS that defines the safe test}
  \item{deltaMin}{NULL, no deltaMin specified because it's a pilot}
  \item{alpha}{the tolerable type I error provided by the user}
  \item{beta}{NULL, no tolerable type II error specified}
  \item{lowDelta}{the smallest delta of the search space for delta provided by the user}
  \item{highDelta}{the largest delta of the search space for delta provided by the user}
  \item{tol}{the step size between lowDelta and highDelta provided by the user}
  \item{lowN}{NULL}
  \item{highN}{NULL}
  \item{alternative}{any of "two.sided", "greater", "less" provided by the user}
  \item{testType}{any of "oneSampleT", "pairedSampleT", "twoSampleT" provided by the user}
  \item{sampleSizeRatio}{default is 1, only used when testType=="twoSampleT" and defines n2=sampleSizeRatio*n1}
  \item{pilot}{TRUE to indicate that the design is a pilot study. The assumption is that the sample sizes are as if they were planned for, thus, known in advance.}
  \item{call}{the expression with which this function is called}
  \item{error}{the error estimated from the inverse function}
  \item{invSToTThresh}{if logging=TRUE then shows the inverse of the t-threshold at various test defining deltaS.}

\description{
"Designs" a safe experiment for a prespecified tolerable type I error by pretending that the sample size is "known"
and fixed ahead of time. Outputs a list that includes the deltaS that defines the safe test.
