\usage{
designSafeLogrank(
  alpha = 0.05,
  beta = NULL,
  thetaMin = NULL,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less"),
  nPlan = NULL,
  ratio = 1,
  zApprox = TRUE,
  tol = 1e-05,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent of n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule S10 > 1/alpha}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both
the sample sizes and deltaS, which defines the test. Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{thetaMin}{numeric that defines the minimal relevant hazard ratio, the smallest hazard ratio that we want to
detect}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less"}

\item{nPlan}{numeric > 0, targetted number of events}

\item{ratio}{numeric representing n2/n1. If n2 equals \code{NULL} then ratio=1}

\item{zApprox}{logical, default TRUE to use the asymptotic normality}

\item{tol}{a number that defines the stepsizes between the lowParam and highParam}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods, but mainly to perform do.calls}
}
\value{
Returns a safeDesign object that includes:

\describe{
  \item{nPlan}{the planned sample size either (1) specified by the user, or (2) computed based on beta and thetaMin}
  \item{parameter}{the parameter that defines the safe test}
  \item{thetaMin}{the minimally clinically relevant hazard ratio specified by the user}
  \item{alpha}{the tolerable type I error provided by the user}
  \item{beta}{the tolerable type II error provided by the user}
  \item{tol}{the step size between lowTheta and highTheta provided by the user}
  \item{alternative}{any of "two.sided", "greater", "less" provided by the user}
  \item{testType}{"logrank"}
  \item{ratio}{default is 1}
  \item{pilot}{FALSE to indicate that the design is not a pilot study}
  \item{call}{the expression with which this function is called}
}
}
\description{
Designs a safe experiment for a prespecified tolerable type I error combined with (1) a targetted number
of events nPlan, or (2) a tolerable type II beta and a minimal clinically relevant hazard ratio thetaMin.
Outputs a list that includes the parameter that defines the safe test.
