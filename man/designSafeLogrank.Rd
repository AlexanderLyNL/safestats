\usage{
designSafeLogrank(
  nPlan = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  beta = 0.2,
  thetaMin = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{nPlan}{numeric > 0, targetted number of events.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule S10 > 1/alpha.}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both "n"
and "deltaS". Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{thetaMin}{numeric that defines the minimal relevant hazard ratio, the smallest hazard ratio that we want to
detect.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{h0}{a number indicating the hypothesised true value of the hazard ratio under the null, i.e., h0=1.}

\item{ratio}{numeric representing n2/n1. If is.null(n2) then ratio=1.}

\item{zApprox}{logical, default TRUE to use the asymptotic normality results.}

\item{tol}{a number that defines the stepsizes between the lowParam and highParam.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}
}
\value{
Returns a safeDesign object that includes:

\describe{
  \item{nPlan}{the planned sample size either (1) specified by the user, or (2) computed based on beta and thetaMin.}
  \item{parameter}{the parameter that defines the safe test. Here log(thetaS).}
  \item{thetaMin}{the minimally clinically relevant hazard ratio specified by the user.}
  \item{alpha}{the tolerable type I error provided by the user.}
  \item{beta}{the tolerable type II error provided by the user.}
  \item{alternative}{any of "two.sided", "greater", "less" provided by the user.}
  \item{testType}{"logrank".}
  \item{ratio}{default is 1.}
  \item{pilot}{\code{FALSE} to indicate that the design is not a pilot study.}
  \item{call}{the expression with which this function is called}
}
}
\description{
Designs a safe logrank test experiment for a prespecified tolerable type I error based on planned sample size(s),
which are fixed ahead of time. Outputs a list that includes thetaS, i.e., the safe test defining parameter.
Computations exploits the asymptotic normality results of the sampling distribution.
