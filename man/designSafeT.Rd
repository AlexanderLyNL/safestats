\arguments{
\item{deltaMin}{numeric that defines the minimal relevant effect size, the smallest effect size that we want to
detect.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent of n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule S10 > 1/alpha}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both
the sample sizes and deltaS, which defines the test. Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less"}

\item{mu0}{a number indicating the hypothesised true value of the mean under the null. For the moment mu0=0}

\item{lowDelta}{numeric that defines the smallest delta of our search space for the test-defining deltaS}

\item{highDelta}{numeric that defines the largest delta of our search space for the test-defining deltaS}

\item{tol}{a number that defines the stepsizes between the lowDelta and highDelta}

\item{lowN}{integer that defines the smallest n of our search space for n}

\item{highN}{integer that defines the largest n of our search space for n. This might be the largest n that we
are able to fund.}

\item{testType}{either one of "oneSampleT", "pairedSampleT", "twoSampleT"}

\item{sampleSizeRatio}{numeric representing n2/n1. If n2 equals \code{NULL} then sampleSizeRatio=1}

\item{logging}{logical, if \code{TRUE} return altSThreshes}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods, but mainly to perform do.calls}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "safeTDesign". An object of class "safeTDesign" is a list containing at least the
following components:

\describe{
  \item{n1Plan}{the planned sample size of the first group}
  \item{mu0}{the specified hypothesised value of the mean or mean difference depending on whether it was a one-sample
  or a two-sample test}
  \item{deltaS}{the deltaS that defines the safe test}
  \item{deltaMin}{the minimal clinical effect size provided by the user}
  \item{alpha}{the tolerable type I error provided by the user}
  \item{beta}{the tolerable type II error provided by the user}
  \item{lowDelta}{the smallest delta of the search space for delta provided by the user}
  \item{highDelta}{the largest delta of the search space for delta provided by the user}
  \item{tol}{the step size between lowDelta and highDelta provided by the user}
  \item{lowN}{the smallest n of the search space for n provided by the user}
  \item{highN}{the largest n of the search space for n provided by the user}
  \item{alternative}{any of "two.sided", "greater", "less" provided by the user}
  \item{testType}{any of "oneSampleT", "pairedSampleT", "twoSampleT" provided by the user}
  \item{sampleSizeRatio}{default is 1. Different from 1, whenever testType equals "twoSampleT", then it's defined
  sampleSizeRatio equals n2/n1}
  \item{pilot}{\code{FALSE} (default) specified by the user to indicate that the design is not a pilot study}
  \item{call}{the expression with which this function is called}
}
}
\description{
Designs a safe experiment for a prespecified minimum clinical relevant effect size, tolerable type I and
type II error. Outputs a list that includes (1) the deltaS that defines the safe test, and (2) nPlan, the sample
size to  plan for.
