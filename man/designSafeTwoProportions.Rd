\title{Design an S-value for a test of two proportions with a certain minimal power
for detecting at least a certain difference delta.min in proportions between
group a and b.}
\usage{
designSafeTwoProportions(
  deltaMin,
  alpha = 0.05,
  beta = 0.2,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less"),
  M = 100,

  sampleSizeRatio = 1,
  lowDelta = 0.1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{deltaMin}{numeric that defines the minimal absolute difference between the group means the
safe test should be designed for, i.e. the minimal relevant difference we want to be able to detect.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the target type 1 error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule S10 > 1/alpha. Default
\code{0.05}.}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the target type II error control necessary to calculate both "n"
and "deltaS". Note that 1-beta defines the power. Default \code{0.20}.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less"}

\item{M}{M Number of simulations used per sample size, per possible S-value, per
data-generating distribution. Default \code{100}.}

\item{lowN}{integer that defines the smallest n of our search space for n. Default 20.}

\item{highN}{integer that defines the largest n of our search space for n. This might be the largest n that we
are able to fund. Default 200.}

\item{sampleSizeRatio}{numeric representing nb/na. Default 1.}

\item{lowDelta}{numeric that defines the smallest delta of our search space for the test-defining deltaS}

\item{highDelta}{numeric that defines the largest delta of our search space for the test-defining deltaS}

\item{tol}{a number that defines the stepsizes between the lowDelta and highDelta}

\item{numberForSeed}{Optionally provide your own seed for the simulations.
Default \code{NA}.}

\description{
\code{designSafeTwoProportions} finds for a given delta.min indicating the minimal
mean difference one wants to detect between group a and b, and a given significance level alpha
and desired type II error guarantee beta the smallest sample size that is needed to detect
that difference. For this sample size, the S-value formula achieving the desired power is
found as well and can be used for performing the a safe test.
