\arguments{
\item{na}{number of observations in group a per data block collected}

\item{nb}{number of observations in group b per data block collected}

\item{nBlocksPlan}{planned number of data blocks collected}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both "n"
and "phiS". Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{delta}{a priori minimal relevant divergence between group means b and a, either a numeric between -1 and 1 for}

\item{alternativeRestriction}{a character string specifying an optional restriction on the alternative hypothesis; must be one of "none" (default),
"difference" (difference group mean b minus group b) or "logOddsRatio" (the log odds ratio between group means b and a).}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule e10 > 1/alpha.}

\item{pilot}{logical, specifying whether it's a pilot design.}

\item{hyperParameterValues}{list containing values for hyperparameters betaA1, betaA2, betaB1 and betaB2, with betaA1 and betaB1 specifying the parameter
equivalent to \code{shape1} in \code{stats::dbeta} for groups A and B, respectively, and betaA2 and betaB2 equivalent to \code{shape2}. By default
chosen to optimize evidence collected over subsequent experiments (REGRET).}

\item{M}{number of simulations used to estimate power or nBlocksPlan. Default \code{1000}.}
}
\value{
Returns a safeDesign object that includes:

\describe{
  \item{nPlan}{the sample size(s) to plan for. Computed based on beta and meanDiffMin, or provided by the user
  if known.}
  \item{parameter}{the safe test defining parameter: here the hyperparameters.}
  \item{esMin}{the minimally clinically relevant effect size provided by the user.}
  \item{alpha}{the tolerable type I error provided by the user.}
  \item{beta}{the tolerable type II error specified by the user.}
  \item{alternative}{any of "two.sided", "greater", "less" based on the \code{alternativeRestriction} provided by the user.}
  \item{testType}{here 2x2}
  \item{pilot}{logical, specifying whether it's a pilot design.}
  \item{call}{the expression with which this function is called.}
