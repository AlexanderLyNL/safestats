\arguments{
\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule S10 > 1/alpha}

\item{beta}{numeric in (0, 1) that speficies the tolerable type II error control necessary to calculate both "n"
and "deltaS". Note that 1-beta defines the power.}

\item{maxN}{numeric, the maximum number of samples one has budget for to collect data}

\item{lowDelta}{numeric that defines the smallest delta of our search space for the test-defining deltaS}

\item{highDelta}{numeric that defines the largest delta of our search space for the test-defining deltaS}

\item{tol}{a number that defines the stepsizes between the lowDelta and highDelta}

\item{testType}{either one of "oneSampleT", "pairedSampleT", "twoSampleT"}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less"}

\item{sampleSizeRatio}{numeric representing n2/n1. If is.null(n2) then sampleSizeRatio=1}

\item{mIter}{the number of replications, that is, experiments with max samples n1Plan and n2Plan}

\item{deltaFactor}{numeric, a factor to robustify the sequential determination (e.g., from deltaTrue = 0.9, to
deltaTrue = 0.8) of lowDelta}

\item{nFactor}{numeric, a factor to robustify the sequential determination (e.g., from deltaTrue = 0.9, to
deltaTrue = 0.8) of highN}

\item{simulateSafeOptioStop}{logical, if TRUE then provides}

\item{logging}{logical, if TRUE then output all the safe designs objects including mean n stop if
simulateSafeOptioStop==TRUE}

\item{backTest}{logical, if TRUE it provides the frequentist sample size necessary to attain the power that the
safe test attains due to optional stopping}

\item{seedNumber}{To set the seed for the simulated data}

\item{freqPlot}{logical, if TRUE plot frequentist sample size profiles}

\item{pb}{logical, if TRUE, then show progress bar}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods, but mainly to perform do.calls}
}
\value{
Plot of the sample size profiles for tolerable type I and type II error, also outputs results object
}
\description{
For given tolerable alpha and beta, as a function of the minimal clinical relevant effect size deltaMin, plots (1) the
sample sizes to plan for for a safe test (2) the frequentist test, (3) the average sample size necessary due to
optional stopping.
