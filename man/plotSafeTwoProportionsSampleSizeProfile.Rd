\title{Function that illustrates that experiments can, on average, be stopped sooner
than planned in the optional stopping setting with tests of two proportions.}
\usage{
plotSafeTwoProportionsSampleSizeProfile(
  alpha,
  beta,
  maxN = 100,
  deltaMinVec = seq(0.9, 0.2, -0.1),
  numberForSeed = NA,
  M = 200,
  highN = 200
)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Significance level used for testing.}

\item{beta}{Maximally acceptable type-II error.}

\item{maxN}{numeric, the maximum number of samples one has budget for to collect data.
Default 100.}

\item{deltaMinVec}{Vector with effect sizes one would want to detect with an
experiment.}

\item{numberForSeed}{Optionally, a seed can be set to make results replicable.}

\item{M}{Number of simulations to be carried out per data generating distribution.
Default 200.}

\item{highN}{Maximal n to sample while determining the design n for each. Default 200.
Increasing this will increase runtime of function significantly.
\code{delta.min}.}
}
\value{
The data used to generate the plot.
}
\description{
For each effect size (absolute difference between mean proportions in group a
and b), the 'design' sample size and S-value to reach at least a power are found
through simulations. Then, for each found combination of delta min, n design and the S-value,
the optional stopping setting is simulated \code{M} times and the average number
of samples collected during optional stopping is recorded.
}
\details{
A plot is then generated, illustrating the difference between the designed sample
size and the sample size collected during optional stopping.

Note that this function only demonstrates the two-sided setting, with equal
group sizes.
