\usage{
safe.t.test(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  designObj = NULL,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
  mu0 = 0,

  var.equal = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a (non-empty) numeric vector of data values}

\item{y}{an optional (non-empty) numeric vector of data values}

\item{designObj}{an object from designSafeT, or NULL, when pilot=TRUE}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less"}

\item{mu0}{a number indicating the hypothesised true value of the mean under the null. For the moment mu0=0}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want to paired t-test.}

\item{var.equal}{a logical variable indicating whether to treat the two variances as being equal. For the moment,
this is always TRUE.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level of the interval. Not yet implemented}

\item{pilot}{a logical indicating whether a pilot study is run. If TRUE, it is assumed that the number of samples is
exactly as planned.}

\item{alpha}{numeric representing the tolerable type I error rate. This also serves as a decision rule and it was
shown that for safe tests S we have P(S > 1/alpha) < alpha under the null.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}
