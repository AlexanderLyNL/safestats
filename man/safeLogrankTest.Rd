\usage{
safeLogrankTest(
  object,
  designObj = NULL,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less"),
  h0 = 1,
  pilot = FALSE,
  alpha = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{either a formula with as outcome variable an object resulting from \code{\link[survival]{Surv}}, or
and object of class "IndependenceProblem" as described in \code{\link[coin]{logrank_test}}.}

\item{designObj}{a safe logrank design obtained from \code{\link{designSafeLogrank}}.}

\item{alternative}{The null hypothesis of equality of the survival distribution of y in the groups defined by x is
tested. When alternative is "two.sided" the null hypothesis being tested is theta = h0, where
theta = lambda2/lambda1 is the hazard ratio. In case alternative = "less", the null hypothesis being tested is
theta >= h0, i.e., for h0=1, the survival is lower in population 1 than in population 2. When
alternative = "greater", the null hypothesis being tested is theta <= h0, i.e., for h0=1, the survival in population
1 is higher than in population 2.}

\item{h0}{a number indicating the hypothesised true value of the hazard ratio under the null. Default set to 1}

\item{pilot}{a logical indicating whether a pilot study is run. If \code{TRUE}, it is assumed that the number of
samples is exactly as planned.}

\item{alpha}{numeric representing the tolerable type I error rate. This also serves as a decision rule and it was
shown that for safe tests S we have P(S > 1/alpha) < alpha under the null.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to \code{\link[coin]{logrank_test}}, such as the "ties.method", "type"
and distribution.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "safeTest". An object of class "safeTest" is a list containing at least the
following components:

\describe{
  \item{statistic}{the value of the z-statistic.}
  \item{n}{The realised sample size(s).}
  \item{sValue}{the s-value for the safe test.}
  \item{confInt}{To be implemented: a safe confidence interval for the hazard ratio.}
  \item{estimate}{To be implemented: an estimate of the hazard ratio.}
  \item{h0}{the specified hypothesised value of hazard ratio.}
  \item{alternative}{any of "two.sided", "greater", "less" provided by the user. Currently, only "two.sided".}
  \item{testType}{"logrank".}
  \item{dataName}{a character string giving the name(s) of the data.}
  \item{designObj}{an object of class "safeDesign" obtained from \code{\link{designSafeLogrank}}.}
  \item{logrankObj}{an object obtained from \code{\link[coin]{logrank_test}}.}
  \item{call}{the expression with which this function is called.}
}
}
\description{
Tests the equality of the survival distributions in two independent groups.
}
\details{
The functions safeLogrankTest are modelled after \code{\link[coin]{logrank_test}} and consists of two
S3 methods, which both make use of the \code{\link{safeLogrankTestCore}}. Details of the arguments are
provided in \code{\link[coin]{logrank_test}}.
