\arguments{
\item{x}{a (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{y}{an optional (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{designObj}{an object obtained from \code{\link{designSafeT}}, or \code{NULL}, when pilot equals \code{TRUE}..}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{h0}{a number indicating the hypothesised true value of the mean under the null. For the moment h0=0}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want a paired t-test.}

\item{varEqual}{a logical variable indicating whether to treat the two variances as being equal. For the moment,
this is always \code{TRUE}.}

\item{confLevel}{confidence level of the interval. Not yet implemented.}

\item{pilot}{a logical indicating whether a pilot study is run. If \code{TRUE}, it is assumed that the number of
samples is exactly as planned.}

\item{alpha}{numeric representing the tolerable type I error rate. This also serves as a decision rule and it was
shown that for safe tests S we have P(S > 1/alpha) < alpha under the null.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}

\item{var.equal}{a logical variable indicating whether to treat the two variances as being equal. For the moment,
this is always \code{TRUE}.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level of the interval. Not yet implemented.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "safeTest". An object of class "safeTest" is a list containing at least the
following components:

\describe{
  \item{statistic}{the value of the t-statistic.}
  \item{n}{The realised sample size(s).}
  \item{sValue}{the realised s-value from the safe test.}
  \item{confInt}{To be implemented: a safe confidence interval for the mean appropriate to the specific alternative
  hypothesis.}
  \item{estimate}{the estimated mean or difference in means or mean difference depending on whether it was a one-
  sample test or a two-sample test.}
  \item{h0}{the specified hypothesised value of the mean or mean difference depending on whether it was a one-sample
  or a two-sample test.}
  \item{stderr}{the standard error of the mean (difference), used as denominator in the t-statistic formula.}
  \item{alternative}{any of "two.sided", "greater", "less" provided by the user.}
  \item{testType}{any of "oneSampleT", "pairedSampleT", "twoSampleT" provided by the user.}
  \item{dataName}{a character string giving the name(s) of the data.}
  \item{designObj}{an object of class "safeTDesign" obtained from \code{\link{designSafeT}}.}
  \item{call}{the expression with which this function is called.}
}
}
\description{
A safe t-test adapted from  \code{\link[stats]{t.test}} to perform one and two sample t-tests on vectors of data.
