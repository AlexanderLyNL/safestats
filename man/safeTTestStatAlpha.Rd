\title{safeTTestStat() Subtracted with 1/alpha.}
\usage{
safeTTestStatAlpha(
  t,
  parameter,
  n1,
  n2 = NULL,
  alpha,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  tDensity = FALSE
)

safeTTestStatAlpha(
  t,
  parameter,
  n1,
  n2 = NULL,
  alpha,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  tDensity = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{numeric that represents the observed t-statistic.}

\item{parameter}{numeric this defines the safe test S, i.e., a likelihood ratio of t distributions with in
the denominator the likelihood with delta = 0 and in the numerator an average likelihood defined by
1/2 time the likelihood at the non-centrality parameter sqrt(nEff)*parameter and 1/2 times the likelihood at
the non-centrality parameter -sqrt(nEff)*parameter.}

\item{n1}{integer that represents the size in a one-sample t-test, (n2=\code{NULL}). When n2 is not \code{NULL},
this specifies the size of the first sample for a two-sample test.}

\item{n2}{an optional integer that specifies the size of the second sample. If it's left unspecified, thus,
\code{NULL} it implies that the t-statistic is based on one-sample.}

\item{alpha}{numeric > 0 only used if pilot equals \code{TRUE}. If pilot equals \code{FALSE}, then the alpha of
the design object is used instead in constructing the decision rule S > 1/alpha.}

\item{alternative}{a character only used if pilot equals \code{TRUE}. If pilot equals \code{FALSE}, then the
alternative specified by the design object is used instead.}

\item{tDensity}{Uses the the representation of the safe t-test as the likelihood ratio of t densities.}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric that represent the e10 - 1/alpha, that is, the e-value in favour of the
alternative over the null - 1/alpha.

\description{
This is basically just \code{\link{safeTTestStat}()} - 1/alpha. This function is used for root finding for
pilot designs.
