\title{Basically just 'safeTTestStat()' - 1/alpha}
\usage{
safeTTestStatAlpha(
  t,
  parameter,
  n1,
  n2 = NULL,
  alpha,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  tDensity = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{numeric that represents the observed t-statistic}

\item{n1}{integer that represents the size in a one-sample t-test, (n2=\code{NULL}). When n2 is not \code{NULL}, this specifies
the size of the first sample for a two-sample test}

\item{n2}{an optional integer that specifies the size of the second sample. If it's left unspecified, thus, \code{NULL} it
implies that the t-statistic is based on one-sample}

\item{alpha}{numeric representing the tolerable type I error rate. This also serves as a decision rule and it was
shown that for safe tests S we have P(S > 1/alpha) < alpha under the null.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less"}

\item{tDensity}{Uses the the representation of the safe t-test as the likelihood ratio of t densities}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric that represent the s10 - 1/alpha, that is, the s-value in favour of the alternative over
the null - 1/alpha
}
\description{
This function is used for root finding for pilot designs
}
\examples{
safeTTestStat(t=1, n1=100, 0.4)
safeTTestStat(t=3, n1=100, deltaS=0.3)
