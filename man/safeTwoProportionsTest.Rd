\title{Perform a Safe Test for Two Proportions with Stream Data}
\usage{
safeTwoProportionsTest(ya, yb, designObj = NULL, pilot = FALSE)

safe.proportion.test(ya, yb, designObj = NULL, pilot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ya}{positive observations/ events per data block in group a: a numeric with integer values
between (and including) 0 and \code{na}, the number of observations in group a per block.}

\item{yb}{positive observations/ events per data block in group b: a numeric with integer values
between (and including) 0 and \code{nb}, the number of observations in group b per block.}

\item{designObj}{a safe test design for two proportions retrieved through \code{\link{designSafeTwoProportions}}.}

\item{pilot}{logical that can be set to true when performing an exploratory analysis
without a \code{designObj}; only allows for \code{na = nb = 1}.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "safeTest". An object of class "safeTest" is a list containing at least the
following components:

\describe{
  \item{n}{The realised sample size(s).}
  \item{eValue}{the e-value of the safe test.}
  \item{dataName}{a character string giving the name(s) of the data.}
  \item{designObj}{an object of class "safeDesign" described in \code{\link{designSafeTwoProportions}}.}
}
}
\description{
Perform a safe test for two proportions (a 2x2 contingency table test) with a
result object retrieved through the design function for planning an experiment to compare
two proportions in this package, \code{\link{designSafeTwoProportions}}.
