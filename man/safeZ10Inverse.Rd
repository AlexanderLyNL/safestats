\title{Computes the Inverse of the Two-Sided Safe Z-Test}
\usage{
safeZ10Inverse(parameter, nEff, sigma = 1, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameter}{optional numeric test defining parameter. Default set to \code{NULL}.
For eType=="eCauchy" the numerator is a mixture with meanDiff/sigma mixed
over a Cauchy distribution centred at zero and scale kappaG. For eType=="eGauss"
the numerator is a mixture with meanDiff/sigma mixed over a Gaussian centred at
zero and variance g. For eType=="grow" the safe test is a likelihood ratio of z distributions with in the
denominator the likelihood with mean difference 0 and in the numerator an average
likelihood defined by the likelihood at the parameter value phiS. For the two sided
case 1/2 at -phiS and 1/2 phiS.}

\item{nEff}{numeric > 0, the effective sample size.}

\item{sigma}{numeric > 0 representing the assumed population standard deviation used for the test.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule e10 > 1/alpha.}
}
\value{
A number that represents a z-value. The function's domain is the positive real line and the range
is the real line, i.e., the outcome space of the z-statistic.
}
\description{
This helper function is used in \code{\link{designSafeZ}()} to find parameter. The function is the (two-sided)
inverse of 'safeZTestStat'.
