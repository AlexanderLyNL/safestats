\title{Computes the inverse of the two-sided safe z-test}
\usage{
safeZ10Inverse(phiS, n, sigma = 1, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{phiS}{numeric this defines the safe test S, i.e., a likelihood ratio of z distributions with in the
denominator the likelihood with mean difference phi = 0 and in the numerator an average likelihood defined by
the likelihood at phiS. For the two sided case 1/2 at phiS and 1/2 at -phiS.}

\item{n}{numeric, the effective sample size}

\item{sigma}{numeric, the assumed known standard deviation, default 1}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule S10 > 1/alpha}
}
\value{
A number that represents a z-value. The function's domain is the positive real line and the range is
the real line, i.e., the outcome space of the z-statistic.
