\title{Computes E-Values Based on the Z-Statistic}
\usage{
safeZTestStat(
  z,
  n1,
  n2 = NULL,
  parameter,
  alternative = c("twoSided", "less", "greater"),
  paired = FALSE,
  sigma = 1,
  eType = c("eGauss", "grow", "eCauchy"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{numeric that represents the observed z-statistic.}

\item{n1}{integer that represents the size in a one-sample z-test, (n2=\code{NULL}). When n2 is not
\code{NULL}, this specifies the size of the first sample for a two-sample test.}

\item{n2}{an optional integer that specifies the size of the second sample. If it's left unspecified, thus,
\code{NULL} it implies that the z-statistic is based on one-sample.}

\item{parameter}{optional numeric test defining parameter. Default set to \code{NULL}.
For eType=="eCauchy" the numerator is a mixture with meanDiff/sigma mixed
over a Cauchy distribution centred at zero and scale kappaG. For eType=="eGauss"
the numerator is a mixture with meanDiff/sigma mixed over a Gaussian centred at
zero and variance g. For eType=="grow" the safe test is a likelihood ratio of z distributions with in the
denominator the likelihood with mean difference 0 and in the numerator an average
likelihood defined by the likelihood at the parameter value phiS. For the two sided
case 1/2 at -phiS and 1/2 phiS.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "twoSided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want the paired z-test.}

\item{sigma}{numeric > 0 representing the assumed population standard deviation used for the test.}

\item{eType}{character one of "eCauchy", "eGauss", "grow". "eCauchy" yields e-values based on
a Cauchy mixture, "eGauss" based on a Gaussian/normal mixture, and "grow" based on a mixture of
two point masses at the minimal clinically relevant effect size.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}
}
\value{
Returns an e-value.
}
\description{
Computes e-values using the z-statistic and the sample sizes only based on the test defining parameter phiS.
