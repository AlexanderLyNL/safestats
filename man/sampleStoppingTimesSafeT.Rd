\arguments{
\item{deltaTrue}{numeric, the value of the true standardised effect size (test-relevant parameter).
This argument is used by `designSafeT()` with `deltaTrue <- deltaMin`}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent of n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule e10 > 1/alpha.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "twoSided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{testType}{either one of "oneSample", "paired", "twoSample".}

\item{ratio}{numeric > 0 representing the randomisation ratio of condition 2 over condition 1. If testType
is not equal to "twoSample", or if nPlan is of length(1) then ratio=1.}

\item{parameter}{optional numeric test defining parameter. Default set to \code{NULL}.
For eType=="eCauchy" the numerator is a mixture with meanDiff/sigma mixed
over a Cauchy distribution centred at zero and scale kappaG. For eType=="eGauss"
the numerator is a mixture with meanDiff/sigma mixed over a Gaussian centred at
zero and variance g. For eType=="grow" the safe test is a likelihood ratio of the
non-central t-distributions with in the denominator the likelihood with non-centrality
parameter set to 0, and in the numerator an average likelihood defined by the likelihood
at the non-centrality parameter value deltaS. For the two sided
case 1/2 at -deltaS and 1/2 deltaS.}

\item{lowN}{integer, smallest sample size (of the first group).}

\item{nMax}{integer > 0, maximum sample size of the (first) sample in each sample path.}

\item{eType}{character one of "eCauchy", "eGauss", "grow". "eCauchy" yields e-values based on
a Cauchy mixture, "eGauss" based on a Gaussian/normal mixture, and "grow" based on a mixture of
two point masses at the minimal clinically relevant standardised effect size.}

\item{wantEValuesAtNMax}{logical. If \code{TRUE} then compute eValues at nMax. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{wantSamplePaths}{logical. If \code{TRUE} then output the (stopped) sample paths. Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{wantSimData}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, then output the simulated data.}

\item{pb}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, then show progress bar.}

\item{seed}{integer, seed number.}

\item{nSim}{integer > 0, the number of simulations needed to compute power or the number of samples paths
for the safe z test under continuous monitoring.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods, but mainly to perform do.calls.}

\value{
a list with stoppingTimes and breakVector. Entries of breakVector are 0, 1. A 1 represents stopping
due to exceeding nMax, and 0 due to 1/alpha threshold crossing, which implies that in corresponding stopping
time is Inf.
