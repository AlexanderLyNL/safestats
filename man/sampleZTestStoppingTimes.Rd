\usage{
sampleZTestStoppingTimes(
  meanDiffMin,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
  sigma = 1,
  kappa = sigma,
  nSim = 1000L,
  nMax = 1000,
  tol = 1e-05,
  highN = 8e+09,
  parameter = NULL,
  grow = TRUE,
  pb = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{meanDiffMin}{numeric that defines the minimal relevant mean difference, the smallest population mean
that we would like to detect.}

\item{alpha}{numeric in (0, 1) that specifies the tolerable type I error control --independent on n-- that the
designed test has to adhere to. Note that it also defines the rejection rule e10 > 1/alpha.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "two.sided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{sigma}{numeric > 0 representing the assumed population standard deviation used for the test.}

\item{kappa}{the true population standard deviation. Default kappa=sigma.}

\item{tol}{a number that defines the stepsizes between the lowParam and highParam.}

\item{highN}{integer that stops the search process if the lower bound for the candidate nPlan exceeds this
number. Default highN is set 8e9 to correspond to the current population of the earth.}

\item{parameter}{optional test defining parameter. Default set to \code{NULL}.}

\item{grow}{logical, defaul set to \code{TRUE} so the grow safe test is used in the design.}
}
\value{
a list with stoppingTimes and breakVector. Entries of breakVector are 0, 1. A 1 represents stopping
due to exceeding nMax, and 0 due to 1/alpha threshold crossing, which implies that in corresponding stopping
time is Inf.
