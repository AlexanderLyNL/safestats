\usage{
setLowAndHighEsTrueZ(
  nEff,
  eType = "mom",
  alternative = "twoSided",
  lowEsTrue = 1e-07,
  highEsTrue = 0.001
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nEff}{numeric > 0, the effective sample size.}

\item{eType}{character string, one of "eCauchy", "eGauss", "grow", "freq", "credibleInterval".
This is somewhat a misnomer as "freq" and "credibleInterval" do not correspond to e-value tests.
"eCauchy" yields an anytime-valid confidence interval based on a Cauchy mixture,
whereas "eGauss" yields an anytime-valid confidence interval based on a Gaussian mixture.
"grow" yields an anytime-valid confidence interval based on a mixture of point masses
at the minimal clinically relevant mean difference. This confidence interval unfortunately
does not shrink as the sample size tends to infinity. "freq" yields the standard unsafe frequentist
confidence interval, which is not safe. "credibleInterval" yields the Bayesian credible interval
based on a conjugate prior as is usual in Bayesian analysis. This interval is also not safe.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis must be one of "twoSided" (default),
"greater" or "less".}

\item{lowEsTrue}{numeric, lower bound for the candidate set of the
targeted minimal clinically relevant effect size.
Design scenario 3: nPlan and beta given, goal find meanDiffMin}

\item{highEsTrue}{numeric, upper bound for the candidate set of the
targeted minimal clinically relevant effect size.
Design scenario 3: nPlan and beta given, goal find meanDiffMin}
